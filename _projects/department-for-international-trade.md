Full-stack developer working on the Department for International Tradeâ€™s LITE project to replace the SPIRE Export Licencing System.

Goal behind the project was to modernise the exporting process for users ranging from one-person businesses to large corporations, as well as build a powerful, automatable yet simple to use case working system for internal users.

I had a diverse set of responsibilities on the team, ranging from building on existing and new codebases, collaborating with others to make important architectural decisions, to giving presentations to senior client stakeholders.
